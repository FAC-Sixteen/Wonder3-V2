* Started creating our first version of our server following Dan's ["super SIMPLE starter kit for Node.js"](https://github.com/sofer/sssk)

### Day 2Ô∏è‚É£ 

* Realised Dan's "super SIMPLE starter kit for Node.js", wasn't as simple as we thought (was a bit too simplified for you to understand within the timeframe of out project)
* Then came the birth of Wonder3-V2

* Figured out that in order to access DOM elements in the backend we needed an API request


### Day 3Ô∏è‚É£

2. Ryan tackled the CSS

## Issues we ran into
